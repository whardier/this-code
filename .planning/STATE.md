# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-25)

**Core value:** Developers using VS Code remote development with multiple profiles never have to think about which instance or --user-data-dir to use -- this-code remembers and routes automatically.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Extension Core + Storage Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Extension Core + Storage Foundation)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-24 -- Roadmap created with 4 phases covering 35 requirements

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 14%

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fixed path `~/.this-code/sessions.db` chosen over `globalStorageUri` for cross-process discoverability
- `@vscode/sqlite3` chosen over `better-sqlite3` for Electron ABI stability
- `extensionKind: ["workspace"]` to run where files are (local or remote)
- Added @types/node as dev dependency — required for os, path, fs/promises, assert type declarations; tsc --noEmit cannot pass without it for extension source
- Did not create extension/src/test/index.ts — @vscode/test-cli discovers tests via .vscode-test.js glob automatically; manual Mocha runner conflicts with test-cli runner contract
- extension/src/config.ts implemented completely in Wave 0 — it uses standard VS Code API (getConfiguration) with no stub needed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- VS Code has no public API for current profile name (issue #177463) -- workarounds need empirical validation in Phase 1
- `onDidCloseTextDocument` fires on language ID changes (false positives) -- needs filtering logic
