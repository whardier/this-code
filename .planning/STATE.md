# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fixed path `~/.which-code/sessions.db` chosen over `globalStorageUri` for cross-process discoverability
- `@vscode/sqlite3` chosen over `better-sqlite3` for Electron ABI stability
- `extensionKind: ["workspace"]` to run where files are (local or remote)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- VS Code has no public API for current profile name (issue #177463) -- workarounds need empirical validation in Phase 1
- `onDidCloseTextDocument` fires on language ID changes (false positives) -- needs filtering logic
